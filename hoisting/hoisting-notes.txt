Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope

JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

var x = 5; // Initialize x

elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element
elem.innerHTML = x + " " + y;           // Display x and y

var y = 7; // Initialize y

This is because only the declaration (var y), not the initialization (=7) is hoisted to the top.

Because of hoisting, y has been declared before it is used, but because initializations are not hoisted, the value of y is undefined.
